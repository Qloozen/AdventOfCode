# Advent of code :christmas_tree:

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme. The event typically starts on December 1st and ends on December 25th.

## How it Works
1. Each day during the season, a new puzzle is released at midnight Eastern Time.
2. Solve the puzzle by writing a program in any language you choose.
3. Submit your solution by using the website. Your solution will be scored based on how fast you submit your puzzle after release.
4. You can visit the global leaderboard to see how you did compared to others. You can also create or join private leaderboards.
