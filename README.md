# Advent of code :christmas_tree:

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme. The event typically starts on December 1st and ends on December 25th.

## How it Works
1. Each day during the season, a new puzzle is released at midnight Eastern Time.
2. Solve the puzzle by writing a program in any language you choose.
3. Submit your solution by using the website. Your solution will be scored based on how fast it runs and how much memory it uses.
4. Come back the next day to see how your solution compares to others, and to get a new puzzle.

## Rules
1. You may use any programming language you choose.
2. You may use any third-party libraries or frameworks you choose.
3. You may not use other people's solutions to these puzzles (including solutions from previous years).
4. You may submit your solution as many times as you like, but only your fastest time will be recorded.
